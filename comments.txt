I took a bit longer than one hour because I had some issues installing
MySQL and getting it to work with Rails. This didn't seem to count
as part of the coding exercise.

The form for the create button doesn't do anything. The path is hardcoded,
I didn't have time to properly set up the Rails form call.

The path to assets is hardcoded. This was done quick and dirty and
should not be done like this in real code.

Normally I'd use css to hide the ***** credit card numbers instead
of jquery but there wasn't time.

(Erased) I didn't have github credentials and couldn't push my code.
Ooops! Went ahead and forked the repository and pushed code there.
